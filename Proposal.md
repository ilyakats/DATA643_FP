# Objective

We will build a recommender system using a large data set in a cloud hosted
spark distributed computing environment. 

We will use the [Amazong video game
ratings](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html) dataset. It has
several options including user-user collaborative filtering as well as item
based filtering.

Given this, we plan on exploring both options as well as how to implement a
hybrid system. 

# Challenges

We for see the hardest part will be the data base admin/distributed computing
environment. While implementing ALS/SVD or even TF-IDF in spark's MLLib might
not be difficult, integrating these into a hybrid system will also be
challenging.
